## Initial idea
*Initial idea / Concept of the Project (aligned to research areas).*

First we wanted to build a complementary tool for teachers that would be used next to the Perception board we did during the first challenge.

We were interested in exploring **future perception and attitudes of school children**. This time around we are interested in using analog wooden tools that include electronics to **prompt moments of reflection and shareback.** During our first intervention we noticed that children tend to get too excited when you incorporate new tools. Therefore, what if we designed tools to help define specific moments for children during the classroom?

We started to look for inspirations online. We were inspired by how teachers asked students to raise their hands to pay attention and regain control of the classroom. This is something that was true for all the 3 classrooms we got to visit during our first intervention with school children in Badalona.

As far as final output and look and feel, we also were inspired by the lovebox DIY project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDEuV73Jc00

We had an idea to design a microphone that would be the starting point for a ritual of active listening and sharing thoughts in a safe space. The microphone, when used, would trigger certain lights or sensors to act up and that would signal the children that its time to listen to their peers. We believe this is an interesting **second moment** when using the perception board. 

This is how we recap what would be happening during the classroom or facilitation session:

(1) Teacher brings a specific topic to the class (either climate change, gender equality and/or mental health)

(2) Children use the Perception Board to identify their points of view in relation to these subjects

(3) Children divide into groups to further reflect on the subject

(4) Once children have had time to gather their thoughts, they share back their debate pitch with the class using the **Speaker Mic.**

## Purpose
*What is supposed to do or not to do.*

### What

**Tool Box** - A portable package that holds all our separate component togehter 

**Card Holder** - A tool that use to spotlight the card that we choose

**Speaker Mic** - An "interactive microphone" that signals the classroom to actively listen to the speaker. This will add on to the experience of using the **Perception Board**. 

The Perception Board:

A "perception board" that allows children and teenagers to **map their sentiments, attitudes and perceptions** around global problems and their potential solutions. 

The introduction of the **Speaker Mic** allows us to define new roles during the session:
- **The Speaker**: Student that is expressing their posture in regards to a debate
- **The Organizer**: Student that makes sure all opinions are captured in the Perception Board
- **The Time Keeper:** Makes sure all activities occur during the defined time slots

### Who
Our goal would be to integrate the tool into a session with teenagers (over 13 years old) have already been using the Perception Board. We want to amplify the classroom experience, using technology and analog data visualization as a means to help the teacher accomplish their educational outcomes during a session.

### Where

Indoors or classroom settings.

### How

This can be done through a workshop or a small game session with our Perception Board.

For **Speaker Mic** we need to integrate:
- 3D printed microphone
- CNC table or stand
- Ultrasonic sensor
- LED strips

### Why
By utilizing the Speaker Mic when sharing reflections after a debate session using the Perception board, we hope to:
- Enable a moment of reflection that is special and requires of everyone's attention.
- Provide protagonism for the Speaker.
- We signal everyone else to stay silent and actively listen.
- Teach children to express their opinions only after they have reflected thoughtfully on the subject matter before.
- To create safe spaces for sharing their thoughts.

With the Cardholder, we would be able to spotlight certain ideas so that everyone who is participating the game can see clearly.

## Planification
*Shown how your team planned and executed the project (Explain personal contributions).*

With limited time and resources and the new task of adding sensors and electronics, we made a plan to ensure that we had realistic goals that would allow us space and time to fail and iterate.

On the first day, we ideated different ways to design a complementary experience to our Perception Board.

These were some of the ideas:
- **LED lights that complement the bulbs of the board.** We felt this didn't add anything new to the experience, only made the functioning of the board slightly better.
- **3 buttons that could give different prompts to set different moments,** i.e. "I disagree", "I agree". We thought these might be difficult to implement when you think of 25 children trying to press the same button.
- **Ways to package and transport the Perception board.** We brainstormed a suitcase, a tray.

Once we agreed on the Speaker Mic, we had a discussion about what to integrate using CNC. We thought of building a tray or some sort of strategy to hold and transport the items or a circular wooden children sized table that would allow us to do the activity.

Here is the plan we designed during the first day. Our focus is to build in the initial three days, while documenting simultaneously. This will allows us to use Thursday to see if we want to integrate more electronics into our final product and focusing on packaging one integrated user journey that also uses the Perception Board.

We also used the morning slot on Monday to figure out the code for the ultrasound sensor.

On the second day, we prepared the digital files for the CNC and received feedback from the Fab Lab team. Our objective is to assemble the microphone and begin using the CNC for the table.

Wen will be in charge of project planning, designing the physical artifacts (table and setting up 3D microphone), documentation, and the Rhino File preparation.

Ariel is in charge of electronics, to figure out how to make the sensor connect to the microphone.

Jimena will be working on the MVP, documentation, system design and ensuring all assets are prepared for fabrication.

As a collective, we execute main jobs such as assembling pieces, designing the journey of the Perception board and the Speaker Mic.


## Integrated design
*Integrated Design (How you designed it - relation between elements)*

First we looked at some references (mentioned above) such as the Love Box. This is because they incorproate hardware and wood to solving a very human problem (i.e. couples in long distance relationships). We wondered what human need in a classroom we can solve using hardware and wood. We then aligned on designing for helping children have the spotlight when speaking up in class and ensuring the rest of the class is silent when they are speaking.

It is a simple system that is a complementary experience to using the Perception Board. We need to assemble the 3D printed microphone and add the ultrasound sensor inside for the first part of the journey. The second step will be to activate lights or a different trigger once motion is detected from the microphone.

This is a first draft of a flow chart showing the way the Speaker Mic interaction would work.

### Design Process

As a first step, we started with ideation and sketches. We did initial sketches of the circular table, wooden tray, portable wooden stool and 3D printed microphone.

![](https://i.imgur.com/31DkPaV.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/2Ez6Yo5.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UgVhPyd.jpg)

We also discussed using a LED screen to signal when children should be listening. We made a sketch about this and a cardboard prototype.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7iVBetM.jpg)

### Electronics

![](https://i.imgur.com/2UpuhiG.png)

Our journey considering one input (the movement) and 2 outpus (light and screen). We used Arduino ESP32 to detect, control and active the system, all components are connected to the same arduino board. First, we detect the movement with the ultrasonic sensor, it emites a sound and measuring the time that it takes to return. When this detects the movement, activate leds and the LED screen.

### Problems

1. Our initial microphone was too small and the sensor could not fit inside. We canceled the printing and increased the scale size to solve this problem.
2. We needed Edu's help to redesign the tray / wooden toolbox and make sure that the material size was correct. This helped us enormously when preparing the files.
3. While assembling the 3D printed Speaker Mic we had some troubles removing the pieces (i.e. the small holes in the microphone) and also making sure the piece was quite sturdy since it would be handled by children. We used super glue to fix this problem.
4. Our printed cards did not fit the card holder perfectly. We solved this by cutting the edges of the cards to make sure they would fit the wooden block.
5. When we used the CNC for the first card holder the holder broke. We solved this by using white glue to fix it together.

### Feedbacks

During this particular challenge, we did not have the morning check-ins with the Fab Lab team, but we asked one on one for their reactions (listed below).
1. **We were adviced to go test with children and teachers in classroom settings** (both the perception board and the Speaker Mic). We plan to do this during the Third Trimester.
2. **We were also adviced to redesign our wooden tray to adjust for the wood's width and for the CNC machine**.
3. **We received feedback regarding the use of the LED scren and strips**. We decided to play around with the length of the strips so they can fit the width of the cardboard box.

## Honest design
*Honest Design (use of technology in a meaningful way, in relation to your interventions)*

We were particularly invested in making any add ons to the experience be as meaningful as possible for the outcome of using the Perception Board, and also not distracting for children. 

We felt that integrating electronics for wayfinding in the Perception Board was meaningful enough without being overly distracting. Also adding electronics to the Speaker Mic to signal when another child is speaking up and thus others should go into "listening mode".

## Exploration

*Explore design boundaries (based on your expertise)*

We were tasked with incorporating more complex electronics this time around and maybe capturing data. We wanted the complementary design to be meaningful to ourselves and to children using the technology. This is why we chose to design around a ritual, which is sharing reflections back with the classroom, and to make that ritual as meaningful as possible through the application of electronics and sensors.

We also wanted our LED interface to be meaningful and add to the design of this specific moment during the workshop, classroom or facilitation session.

## Fabrication process

For the Fabrication process we defined the following: 
- Electronics for ultrasound sensor (LED screen, LED strip and LED bulb)
- CNC machine for wood cutting card holder and tray
- 3D printing for the microphone
- Manual assembling and cutting (for cardboard sensor box with velcro)

### Day 1

On Monday we started playing with electronics with the ultrasound sensor and the LED stripes.

We also set up the 3D printing of the microphone's individual parts using white as the chosen color. The printing takes over 10 hours and we left it overnight. 

Initially, we struggled with the file because the size was too small (only 4cm wide, we changed the file to 6cm). We also realized that printing 2 separate sets of files is more time efficient than having one big file.

### Day 2

On Wednesday, we checked our 3D printed artefact.

![](https://i.imgur.com/hob9gQT.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/rYhJszf.jpg)

Everything printed correctly. However we struggled slightly with detaching the negative space and making sure the press fit was precise. 

During the morning we also explored alternatives to incorporating CNC. We let go of the idea of the table because it didn't feel meaningful enpugh and so we explored building a tray that would allow us to fit the Perception board's pointers, cards and our new **Speaker Mic**.

For designing the card holder, we went through a few iterations. This is because we are looking for a more simple and modular structure

![](https://i.imgur.com/nJLtUNi.png)

It is quite hard to take it out, so what we did was we tried to het up the board to about 40-60C so that it will come off more easily.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2DbenAX.png)

We found a block and we are planning to replicate it here.

![](https://i.imgur.com/M7pmhvy.jpg)

During our brainstorming session, we were trying to come out with a way to better organize our tools.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gHKhPBD.jpg)

We then chose to use the CNC to build a card holder that had an improved design than our original idea of cutting up wooden blocks.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6uJFhyp.jpg)
This is what the design looked like before sanding.

We also used the CNC to fabricate a wooden tray that would hold the laser cut pointers.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qcByQnK.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/hDeVAlp.jpg)

This is what our final design looked like.

### Day 3
On Thursday we sanded the wooden tray and the cardholders that we had fabricated yesterday using the CNC machine. We also made minor adjustments to the physical objects (i.e. adjusting the size of the cards so they would fit the cardholder).

We also dedicated time to sketching the system diagram for the cardboard box with the Arduino and electronics and also for the whole system (including instructions on how to use).

We finally placed all the pieces as a whole and set up the final code on Arduino to make sure the Speaker Mic would work. We also added the LED strips to the inside of the sensor box.

## Future Development and Opportunities

1. We can build a larger tray to fit all the items in one comparment.
2. We can redesign the cards and the written content after testing with a classroom.
3. We can make individual compartments for the 3 different types of pointers.
4. We can design an app or digital product for teachers to use while they are using the Perception Board and Speaker Mic. This can help us track data of the classroom's performance and help them navigate all the different tools.
